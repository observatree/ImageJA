Fork of ImageJ 1.x with Changes for AstroImageJ
===============================================

Changes to ImageJA for AstroImageJ by Karen A. Collins are in the ai8 branch.

Preserve master for updates from NIH's [upstream repository](https://github.com/imagej/ImageJA),
and periodically merge them into the ai8 branch.

The maven build in the ai8 branch works standalone, but its functionality is best understood
as a submodule of the [wrapper project](https://github.com/observatree/aij) that builds both
the ij and Astronomy_ artifacts.
